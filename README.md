# (Data Visualization by Using Tableau 10/2024) Understanding-Missing-Migrants-and-Their-Tragic-Journeys

## Outline

The Story contains four Dashboards (Two of them are quite the same. The first Dashboard 1 does not have worksheet filtering and the second Dashboard 1 can filter different charts based on filters).

* The first dashboard (Two of the Dashboard 1) is mainly based on the year.
* The second dashboard is mainly based on the number of people (Women, Men, and Children), and evidence (Dead and Survivors)
* The last dashboard is mainly based on the migration route.

## Dashboard 1
Analysis of: 
* Total number of deaths and disappearances related to the year
* Minimum Estimated Number of Missing
* Number of Dead
* Number of Survivors

## Dashboard 2
Analysis of: 
* Region of Survivors and Dead Ratio
* Top 9 Dead by Region
* Top 9 Survivors by Region
* Number of Children, Males, Females, and Sum in each Year
* Percentage of Dead Along Migration Rout in each year

## Dashboard 3
Analysis of: 
* Cause of Death
* Migration Route
* Origin vs Incident
* Region of Incident

## Reconmendation
There are three routes that have a higher possibility of causing death. They are the US-Mexico border crossing, the Sahara Desert crossing, and the Central Mediterranean. Also, the most frequent reason for death is drowning. Therefore, the report suggest that scholars should pay more attention to these routes and their regions and the drowning to conduct research.
